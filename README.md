## Description

A CRUD application that contains a Word class utilized to create a psuedo dictionary. The homepage of the app lists all submitted words. When a word is clicked, it leads to a page with the word's definitions. Users can add words, and when viewing a word, are able to add, update or delete one or more definitions.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Must install Ruby 2.6.5 on your machine to successfully run this application.
- Upon successful project download navigate to the project's root directory.
- In your terminal type "bundle"
- To start application type "ruby app.rb" in your terminal

## Bugs
